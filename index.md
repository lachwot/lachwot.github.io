Welcome to the main page for the Monash Tidy Tabletops Dataset. This dataset was developed by [Lachlan Wotherspoon](https://github.com/lachwot) as a part of the 2020-2021 Summer Research Program at Monash University, in our paper titled: "Tidy Tables: Generating Scenes Using Geometric and Semantic Preferences".

The dataset is currently being hosted on the Monash Bridges platform and is available for download [here](https://google.com)

### The Dataset
This dataset contains a total of 6000 pairs of RGB color images, of 10 tabletop objects arranged in random positions. Each pair of scenes contains either 2,3,4 or 5 objects of random classes. Between the pairs of scenes the pose of a single object is changed while the rest remain in the same positions. The dataset generator was produced using the [PyRep](https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep) API's for the [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) robotics simulator.

|Example Scenes|

The aim of the dataset is to provide a stepping stone into the currently unexplored field of robotic object rearrangement (we've called it the "tidy up problem"). Most algorithms require both training data and validation data in order to gague and measure their performance. Each of the pairs of scenes has been given user ratings as to which of the two scenes they believe is tidier than the other, and each have metadata files relevant to the individual scenes. These ratings were the result of an [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) crowdsourcing survey involving all scenes in the dataset.

## How can I download and use this dataset?
As mentioned earlier the dataset is available for public download from the Monash Bridges Platform: [(To be added)](https://google.com)
Under the root of the folder, the structure should be as follows (Add structure in here)

### Using the datset
To regenerate scenes and perform data analysis, you can use the `scene_parser` python file.
This file assumes the default directory structure (from the Monash Bridges download), so be sure to avoid changing that. 
The `scene_parser` file allows you to read the metadata files, and stores each of those in an array. The data availiable is as follows, per object (each element of an array will have these fields):
`class`: The class of the object, this will match one of the names of the objects in the object set.
`position`: The 3DOF XYZ position of the object.
`orientation`: The 3DOF Roll, Pitch, Yaw of the object.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lachwot/lachwot.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
