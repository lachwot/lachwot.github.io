Welcome to the main page for the Monash Tidy Tabletops Dataset. This dataset was developed by [Lachlan Wotherspoon](https://github.com/lachwot) as a part of the 2020-2021 Summer Research Program at Monash University, in our paper titled: "Tidy Tables: Generating Scenes Using Geometric and Semantic Preferences".

The dataset is currently being hosted on the Monash Bridges platform and is available for download [here](https://google.com)

### The Dataset
This dataset contains a total of 6000 pairs of RGB color images, of 10 tabletop objects arranged in random positions. Each pair of scenes contains either 2,3,4 or 5 objects of random classes. Between the pairs of scenes the pose of a single object is changed while the rest remain in the same positions. The dataset generator was produced using the [PyRep](https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep) API's for the [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) robotics simulator.

Scene A | Scene B
| --- | --- |
![Example Scene 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lachwot/lachwot.github.io/main/pair_5_31_1_scene.jpg) | ![Example Scene 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lachwot/lachwot.github.io/main/pair_5_31_2_scene.jpg)

The aim of the dataset is to provide a stepping stone into the currently unexplored field of robotic object rearrangement (we've called it the "tidy up problem"). Most algorithms require both training data and validation data in order to gague and measure their performance. Each of the pairs of scenes has been given user ratings as to which of the two scenes they believe is tidier than the other, and each have metadata files relevant to the individual scenes. These ratings were the result of an [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) crowdsourcing survey involving all scenes in the dataset.

# How can I download and use this dataset?
As mentioned earlier the dataset is available for public download from the Monash Bridges Platform: [(To be added)](https://google.com)
Under the root of the folder, the structure should be as follows (Add structure in here)

Install the [CoppeliaSim robotics](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) simulator from the official [website](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads). Choose the version that best suits you and extract the tar file into your home directory.

Install [PyRep](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/PyRep.htm), the Python interface for Coppeliasim from github:
```bash
# In your home directory,
git clone https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep.git
cd PyRep

# Adding to the '~/.bashrc' file
export COPPELIASIM_ROOT=EDIT/ME/PATH/TO/COPPELIASIM/INSTALL/DIR
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$COPPELIASIM_ROOT
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=$COPPELIASIM_ROOT

# Source your ~/.bashrc file and install the python library:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install .
```

### Using the datset
To regenerate scenes and perform data analysis, you can use the `scene_regenerator.py` python file. This is shown here:
This file assumes the default directory structure (from the Monash Bridges download), so be sure to avoid changing that.
